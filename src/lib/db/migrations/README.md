# Database migrations

This directory is owned by Drizzle Kit. Generate migrations with
`npm run db:generate` and apply them with `npm run db:migrate`.

The initial migration also contains the foreign key from `public.users.id` to
Supabase's managed `auth.users.id`. Do not add the `auth` schema to Drizzle's
managed schema exports.
